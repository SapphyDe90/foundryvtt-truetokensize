### FOUNDRYVTT - TRUE TOKEN SIZE

This module automatically scales tokens based on actor or species' height (supports both 'Characters' and 'Pokémon' with a Species), for PTR 1e with the Isometric Perspective module.

**How to use it:**
- For Characters (or Trainers), make sure the Height field in their character sheet is filled in meters.
- For Pokémon, make sure the Height field in their Species entry is correctly filled in meters.
*Notes:*
- If the scaling doesn’t work at first, try removing the token from the map and placing it again.
- If it still doesn’t work, make sure to use periods (.) instead of commas (,) for decimals in the Height field.
- Also, double-check that the height is entered in meters.
